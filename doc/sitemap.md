# Sitemap

This plugin suggests to install the Sylius sitemap plugin. The plugin is not installed automatically, but to install run:

```bash
    $ composer require stefandoorn/sitemap-plugin ^2.2
``` 

It's already configured after installation and contains a page & section provider. 

For more information, read the original [SitemapPlugin documentation](https://github.com/stefandoorn/sitemap-plugin).
