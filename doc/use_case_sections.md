With sections, you can organize your blocks and pages under some specific categories.
For instance, you can create a Blog section and display pages and blocks under it.

Sections in the Bitbag SyliusCmsPlugin serve as containers where various elements, such as content blocks, CMS pages,
and media, can be placed. These sections allow administrators to organize and manage the layout and presentation of content on pages.
The ability to place blocks, pages, and media within sections provides full control over the appearance and structure of CMS pages,
enabling the creation of visually appealing and cohesive content layouts. Sections offer flexibility in designing pages,
allowing for customization and adaptation of displayed content to user preferences and marketing strategies.
