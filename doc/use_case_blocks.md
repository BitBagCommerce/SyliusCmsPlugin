# Blocks

With the SyliusCmsPlugin, administrators can create and manage blocks built from content elements.

This allows for customized content presentation, showcasing product features, promotions, and relevant information.

The plugin provides flexibility in organizing and managing blocks,
empowering administrators to create an engaging browsing experience tailored to each page's context.

By leveraging this feature, administrators can effectively communicate product details, enhance cross-selling opportunities,
and provide valuable information to customers. Overall,
the plugin enables targeted and contextual content delivery across various pages.

**Note.** If you haven't implemented the blocks properly in your code yet, please visit the [Blocks](blocks.md) tech doc.

### Optional configuration

In the form, you will find additional fields, which will help you with your e-commerce related content:

- Display for products - You can select specific products that are associated with the block. This allows the block to be displayed on the product pages of the selected products.
- Display for products in taxon - This field allows you to select specific taxon associated with the block. By choosing relevant taxon, the block will be displayed on the product pages related to those taxon. Only "Main Taxon" is taken.
