Blocks represent single parts of your Sylius web app, where you can put some content hardcoded in the 
template and change it in the future from admin panel.

With the Bitbag SyliusCmsPlugin, administrators have the ability to arrange content blocks within sections and manage them in a way that they can even be displayed on the product page.

The plugin allows administrators to create sections within CMS pages and organize content blocks within these sections. This provides a structured approach to content layout, enabling administrators to control the placement and ordering of blocks on the page.

By leveraging this functionality, administrators can customize the content presentation not only on informational or static pages but also on dynamic pages like the product page. They can strategically insert relevant content blocks within sections to showcase product features, promotions, related articles, or any other desired information.

This flexibility empowers administrators to create a cohesive and engaging browsing experience for customers, where the content blocks can dynamically adapt to the context of each page. It enables them to tailor the content display to effectively communicate product details, enhance cross-selling opportunities, or provide additional information to customers while they explore specific products.

In summary, the Bitbag SyliusCmsPlugin allows administrators to arrange content blocks within sections and manage them in a way that they can be displayed on various pages, including the product page. This feature provides a high degree of customization and control over the content presentation, enabling administrators to deliver targeted and contextual information to website visitors.
