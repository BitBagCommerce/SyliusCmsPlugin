# BitBag SyliusCmsPlugin

- [⬅️ Back](./installation.md)

## Installation - Import plugin entry into existing project entry.js files

- ✔️ Same webpack configuration for plugin and project assets
- ✔️ No need to edit templates - it's good for quick testing
- ⚠ Assets are loaded globally which can affect page speed

1. Just add these imports into your entry.js files

```js
// ./assets/shop/entry.js
import '../../vendor/bitbag/cms-plugin/src/Resources/assets/shop/entry.js';

// ./assets/admin/entry.js
import '../../vendor/bitbag/cms-plugin/src/Resources/assets/admin/entry.js';
```
