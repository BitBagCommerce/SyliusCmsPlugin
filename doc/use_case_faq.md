# Frequently Asked Questions

FAQ is a common part of each eCommerce website. You can add them in your admin panel by configuring question, answer, and position. All results will be paginated in the storefront.

The BitBag SyliusCmsPlugin allows administrators to add and display questions and answers within the FAQ section on various pages, including the product page.

This feature enables the easy management and presentation of frequently asked questions, providing valuable information to customers within a dedicated FAQ section.

**Note.** If you haven't implemented the FAQ properly in your code yet, please visit [FAQ](faqs.md) tech doc.
